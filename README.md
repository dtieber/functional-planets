### Functional Planets :earth_africa:

This project contains a fairly simple application that provides you with information about our solar system. Main goal of this project is to explore tacit/functional libraries for JavaScript/TypeScript.

### Notes

Following scenarios got covered somewhere in this repo:
* Validation of input (chain of errors, no short circuit)
  * plus IO-TS types
* Combination of results (e.g. 2 calls and need to combine data from both)
* Consecutive execution (e.g. 3 tasks that run one after another, results are irrelevant)
* BonusMission: TaskEither
